# FolderSorter

This is a package that allows you to sort files inside of a certain folder.

As this is a demo-version, please pay attention to the fact that **some conditions must be met** in order for the app to work correctly:
- you must call the *sortFolder* procedure from a folder one step above the sorted folder;
- the sorted folder name is read from system argument [1], and thus must be entered correctly.

After the procedure has finished working, an error message is displayed due to some reason. **Do not pay attention to it - the programm still has worked properly.**
