# FolderSorter

This is a package that allows you to sort files inside of a certain folder.

As this is a demo-version, please pay attention to the fact that some conditions must be meeted in order for the app to work correctly:
- you must call the "sortFolder" procedure from a folder one step above the sorted folder;
- the sorted folder must be names "TSC".

After the procedure has finished working, an error message is displayed due to some reason. Do not pay attention to it - the programm still has worked properly.
